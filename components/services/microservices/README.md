## Services

> [!WARNING]
> **Hi**, just saying, nothing is permanant here, this is random stuff that came by my head and I thought made sense, but it can definitely be changed, so don't hesitate :+1:

- `api-service/`
  - A REST API designed to be a bridge with other micro-services

- `auth-service/`
  - Handles authentication matters, like direct login, registration, or 2FA

- `chat-service/`
  - Chat (global, private) and group management
